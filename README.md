Current Quality Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering in Automotive and Aerospace industries intending to make a career change to Software Engineering with a focus on back-end Python development.

Experience working with pre-production product life (stress analysis to drive design changes to improve product performance, set-up of new manufacturing line) and post-production (analyzing defect data to capture quality issues and drive manufacturing changes to eliminate concerns).

Technology and computers have been a central focus of my life since I was little. I've seen computers grow from command-line operating systems to the complex systems we have today. I took an interest in web development when I was younger, self-teaching myself HTML, PHP, and SQL to make websites purely out of curiosity. This passion continued into adulthood by both tinkering with new technologies as they release, and by leveraging these skills in my Mechanical Engineering background to help accelerate my career. After some time in the Mechanical realm, I have realized it is time to turn my passion and hobby into a profession.
