    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Passionate, self-taught Software Engineer with experience developing 
      in a variety of languages including Python (primary), C#, C++, 
      JavaScript, and many others.

      My drive for learning in the software and tech world began when I was 
      in Middle School where I learned to design and develop full featured 
      websites using languages from as simple as HTML and CSS to more 
      advanced such as PHP or JavaScript. This early experience gave me a 
      solid foundation and sparked a lifelong passion that I've continued 
      to develop.

      In University, I took several programming courses outside of my chosen 
      major (Mechanical Engineering) that helped to reignite this passion. 
      Through these courses I deepened my understanding of software 
      development and kicked off various passion projects that have helped me 
      to continue learning and honing these skills.

      My latest journey in the tech world has driven me to developing in Python, 
      working on back-end and full-stack projects utilizing a large breadth of 
      libraries and frameworks from Django to Pytest.

        icon: "/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg"
        tagline: |
         First project used to practice developing with Python. Bot that 
         monitors stock of given product URL (intended to monitor GPU's 
         during GPU shortage) and quickly purchase once stock has become 
         available. Used Selenium to interact with browser and various 
         strategies to mask bot from detection. Capable of identifying 
         stock and executing a purchase within 10 seconds of stock becoming 
         available.

        tagline: |
         Second project in Python, developed after studying software 
         architecture and clean coding practices. Django web app that 
         uses live stock market data and allows users to create mock stock 
         portfolios to test trading strategies. Used to expand knowledge of 
         Python development, gain experience developing a front-end with 
         Python, and practice implementation of various software architecture 
         practices and principles such as Test Driven Development and SOLID.
