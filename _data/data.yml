    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Mechanical Engineer seeking to leverage data analytics skills, 
      effective team-based communication, project management experience, 
      and passion for technology to make a career change into Software 
      Engineering. Previous work history in product design and 
      manufacturing has instilled with me a foundation of organization, 
      appreciation for implementing and following defined standards, and 
      problem solving skills to meet deadlines, ensure customer 
      satisfaction, and continous improvement.

      Software has been a passion of mine since I was young. Interests in 
      computers, general technology, and a DIY-attitude has led to my 
      personal development of software skills both academically (stacks 
      of books) and personally (various personal projects).
